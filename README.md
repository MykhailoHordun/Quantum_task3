## Tasks 1 and 2
### To run tasks 1 and 2
  1. Save this repo
  2. Install all requirements
  3. Open file tasks_1_2.jpynb 
  4. Run cells with code

## Task 3
### To run task 3
  1. Save this repo
  2. Install all requirements
  3. Open file task3.jpynb
  4. In second cell change path to folder where you have files "internship_train.csv" and "internship_hidden_test.csv"
  5. Run cells with code

## Task 4
### To run task 4
  1. Save this repo
  2. Install all requirements
  3. Open file task4.jpynb
  4. Change change path to folder where you have file "T36UXV_20200406T083559_TCI_10m.jp2" and folder "masks"
  5. If you do not run it using Google Colaboratory:
    5.1 Preferebly to have CUDA 11.1 and Python 3.10.10
    5.2 Change values of image_path and mask_path in the augumentation cell
  6. Run code
  
### Use pretrained model
  To use pretrained model uo need to download file erosion_model.h5 from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14c-lylZR9fawOkoaQSyqTOVs6SFt7rea) and set parameter pretrained_weights as pash to this file 

### Solution report
  You can find solution report to task4 in "task4 solution report.pdf" file
